# Tree Indicies
**Indecies** are a class of data structure that allow lookup via a single key and support efficient modification. 

## B+ Trees
The key idea is the have iterative lookup pages (i.e. lookup pages for lookup pages for lookup pages and so on). More formally, a **B+ tree** is a dynamic tree index that is always balanced. It has a high fanout and supports efficient insertion and deletions. It grouws at the root, *not* at the leaves.
